The reason of get a false is in the Employee's equals() method. Because it compare with 
the Boolean property visited. But EmployeeInfo class doesn't have initialized the Employee 
class with visited.

To solve this problem, change the method equals() in Employee and set '&& emp.visited == 
visited;' to '|| emp.visited == visited;' .
