i. When the type D is a class
If B and C are all interface, and not implement the method() method in them. When D 
implements B and C, like 'public class D implements B, C'. You need to implement the 
method(), default will implement the B's method();

If B and C are all interface, and only implement the method() method in B use default.
When D implements B and C, you need to implement the method() from C.java or Override the 
method() inherit from B.java. If you want to use super method in B, you need to implement 
B.super.method() in D's method().



ii. When the type D is an interface.
If D is a interface, D needs to extends B and C. If B and C are not implement method() 
from A. Then D doesn't need to implement method(); if B or C, then D needs to implement
method(), or Override method() with default.
